# Financial Data Analysis Project

This project is a simple financial data analysis tool that calculates and visualizes key financial metrics based on provided revenue and expense data. The project utilizes Python libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and Plotly for numerical computations and data visualization.

## Features

- **Gross Profit Calculation:** Calculates the gross profit for each month by subtracting expenses from revenue.
- **Profit After Tax Calculation:** Computes the profit after applying a 30% tax to the gross profit.
- **Profit Margin Calculation:** Determines the profit margin as a percentage of revenue for each month.
- **Good and Bad Months Identification:** Identifies months with above-average (good) and below-average (bad) profits.
- **Visualization:** Provides visualizations of revenue, expenses, gross profit, and the identification of good and bad months using Matplotlib and Plotly.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Plotly

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/financial-data-analysis.git
   cd financial-data-analysis

2. Install the required Python packages:
   
  ```bash
  python financial_analysis.py
  ```

## Usage
Run the script using Python:
  ```bash
  python financial_analysis.py
  ```

The script will output key financial metrics, including:

Gross Profit
Profit After Tax
Profit Margin
Identification of Good and Bad Months
The best and worst months based on profit
Additionally, the script will generate two visualizations:

A line plot of revenue and expenses across the months.
A line plot of gross profit across the months using Plotly.
